Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following was concluded;

From our analysis we see that customers with high international calls are less likely to churn as compared to total day calls, total eve calls, and total night calls. The company should then promote more international calls.

Customers with high number of minutes used during the day are more likely to churn. Morever, customers with a high charge on day time usage are more likely to churn. The company should focus on lowering charges charged during the day.

Customers who made more customer service calls are more likely to churn. The company should therefore focus on resolving complains made by customers.

Customers with high number of voice mails are less likely to churn. The company should encourage customers to use voice mails.

The Decision Tree model had the highest accuracy score and F1 Score, and lowest mean squared error, mean absolute error. Therefore, the Decision Tree Classifier is a good fit for predicting the customer churn.

From the Decision Tree Classifier Feature Importance we can see that total day minutes, total int charge, total intl calls are the most important features for predicting customer churn.Therefore, the company should focus on these features to reduce the customer churn.

The Decision Tree model is performing relatively well with a higher AUC, indicating strong discriminatory power.
